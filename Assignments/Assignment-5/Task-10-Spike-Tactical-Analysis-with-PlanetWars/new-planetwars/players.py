"""Player and bot-controller integration for PlanetWars.

The ``Player`` class acts as both the game's internal player representation
and the *façade* through which bot controllers interact with the simulation.

Each game step the ``PlanetWars`` game updates the information held by the
player, taking into account the entities the player is actually aware of.
The Player then passes itself to the bot controller, which issues orders
(via the Player order methods). The orders may be ignored if they are invalid.

The Player façade represents a "fog-of-war" view of the true game
environment. A player bot can only "see" what is in range of its own
occupied planets or fleets in transit across the map. This creates an
incentive for bots to exploit scouting details.
