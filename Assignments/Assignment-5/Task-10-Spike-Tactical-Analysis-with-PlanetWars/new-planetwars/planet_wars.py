"""PlanetWars core game engine.

This module contains the ``PlanetWarsGame`` class — the authoritative source
of truth for the entire simulation. It manages the game loop phases
(player orders → growth → fleet movement → combat resolution → façade sync),
enforces all rules, and maintains the canonical state of every planet and
fleet.
